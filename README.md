# Snake Game
A snake game on the web, created using vanilla HTML, CSS and JavaScript

## How to play 
The game is currently not being hosted, but it can be self-hosted very easily through a HTML live server.
 
The movement is simple, use the WASD keys to move up(w) left(a) down(s) and right(d)
and to pause the game you can either press ESC or click the menu button at the top right corner of the game.
 
You can also play on mobile with the movement buttons on the screen which provide WASD keys.
